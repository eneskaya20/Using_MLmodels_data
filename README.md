# Breast Cancer Prediction
This project aims to predict breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. This project uses the scikit-learn library in Python to build and evaluate various machine learning models.

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

data.csv - input data file
breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing all the code and experiments
README.md - this file
## Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed, along with the following libraries:

-pandas
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-sklearn

The easiest way to install these libraries is by using pip package installer.
## Usage
The breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb notebook contains all the code required to train and test the machine learning models. The notebook is self-explanatory and describes each step in detail.
